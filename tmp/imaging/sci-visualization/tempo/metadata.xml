    TEMPO (Topographic Eeg Mapping Program) is software for 3D visualization
    of brain electrical activity.  TEMPO is able to read EEG recordings in
    standard EDF format and to create animated sequence of 3D topographic
    maps with EEG activity color-coded over scalp region.  The primary
    strength of TEMPO approach to topographic mapping is ability to examine
    the same map from different viewpoints - user is able to navigate around
    head object using mouse.  Individual topographic maps could be saved in
    PNG format for future examination.  The animation, as well as mapping
    parameters, are controllable through corresponding graphical user
    interface.
